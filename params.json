  "body": "### The Problem\r\nMost of the real time systems cannot be debugged using traditional methods such as breakpoints or tracepoints. The observer effect plays really well here, the act of stopping a thread could change the entire behavior of the system. Or, could crash the system itself.\r\n\r\nIn the case of reactive programming, it is almost impossible to understand what happened or most importantly how the thread got here.\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\nIn both cases, a mere least intrusive way of capturing minimum debug information and maintaining it for debug purposes is very useful. Every real-time system I know of has a mechanism like this, for example.\r\n\r\nThis library attempts to create a generic tracing mechanism for usage in almost all computing models.",
